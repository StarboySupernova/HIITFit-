    // Now that you’re going to store ratings, RatingView is a better source of truth than ExerciseView. Instead of storing ratings in ExerciseView, you’ll pass the current exercise index to RatingView, which can then read and write the rating

    //You set up a ratings view that allows the user to rate the exercise difficulty from one to five. You’ll save this rating to UserDefaults so that your ratings don’t disappear when you close the app. We will use @AppStorage for that and remove the @State variable
    /*when we did the above, passing $rating to the ratings view init in this folder still worked, which leads us to surmise that @AppStorage exposes a binding somehow */
